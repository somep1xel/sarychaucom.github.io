                <p>Since moment of rising to power of Alexander Lukashenko in 1994, the whole generation of Belarusians has grown up. These are young people who soon will determine the future of the country. Do they want to initiate changes, or vice versa, will avoid them?
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I want to understand what this generation is concerned with, what they feel living in today’s Belarus. I am interested in the limits of their responsibility and courage, the degree of involvement into the actual processes, their need for change. I would like to give an opportunity to the chorus of daring, dreamy, quiet, sometimes apathetic and indifferent, helpless and often conflicting voices to be heard.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This generation seems to be looking at the reality with from a new perspective, and sooner or later they would start changing the social environment, public space, culture and many other things. To change everything that got frozen somewhere between the Soviet era socialism and a mixture of suppressed capitalism and a fear of authoritarianism.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                  When talking with young people, I often felt the air of the past generation. But at the same time many of my characters showed an active position, they think critically and act much bolder than their environment, they are not afraid to stand out and go against the stream. I want to believe that it is from such individuals that the core of a new generation of the Belarusians is formed and that they would be free enough to make the world a more pleasant place to live.

                  <i>I finished doing a make-up artist course, and now I want to take up a hairdresser’s course and learn to design clothes - to make people and the world more beautiful. I want to earn money, to buy a turntable and make my own home studio. I would like to travel. I am looking for myself now. We have this life to explore all the corners of the world and find ourselves, rather than to stay at one place thinking how bad everything is and how tired we are of Lukashenko. I do not care about it all.</i>
                  <i>I want to find someone to love, to travel together, make a lot of children. And I would not want them to see this darkness that surrounds us. I want people not to ignore their lives because of uncertainty, without even trying to change something, not to give up but keep moving towards their goals.</i>

                <i>Our president adopted a decree according to which he can remain in office for more than one term, which is contrary to the constitution. I would like to have another president to get everything put in motion, even if it temporarily makes the situation worse, the country would develop.</i>

                <i>My parents (my mother is a kindergarten educator, my father is a driver) voted against Lukashenko. They see no differences in the country: palaces are built, sport is promoted, but there are no real changes. My elder brother is a businessman. He understands that somethings goes wrong in the country, but he is convinced that until he has food and heating, there is no need aiming at changes and risking, expressing one’s opinion. And I do not want to be a part of the system, to lead a monotonous life at the same place. After the 3rd year I am planning to take a gap year and try to take up a Master’s course in Sweden.</i>

And we are not ready to act individually either. At the elections in 2010, there was an overall breakout, and where are all these people now? In prison, that is all. The state keeps promising us something, then it does not keep these promises, and we continue to wait and do nothing.</i>

                <i>Protests will change nothing, people will just face more problems. It is senseless trying to reach something doing this, however massive the event is. Look at the examples of other countries: so many rallies, protests, people gather together holding posters -- and what do they actually achieve? I have never seen people going out to the streets and achieving something. Yes, people in the Ukraine got involved into a war. This is what they have now.</i>

                <i>Our society is gradually becoming more free. For example, in terms of getting information. Authorities can not control the Internet the way they did with television, radio and newspapers. Therefore, space for critical thinking is formed. Today people become witnesses more often, they shoot videos about what is happening using their mobile phones. I do not divide the society into black and white, left and right. The more people you meet, the more opinions you encounter, the better you realize that there is no single correct answer. We perceive information differently. But the main thing is to have it available all the time.</i>
                <i>It is important for me to feel inner freedom. I want people to understand that we are all equal. The state is the mathematical sum of people. There is nothing supernatural that dominated us, anything higher and stronger than us. When you defend your position, you should not be afraid of the authorities. They are just like us.</i>

I do not like living here and I do not like our journalism, so I do not want to stay in Belarus. There are no prospects for further development.</i>
                <i>I am not ready to take part in protests, because I am afraid of the consequences. The elections in 2010 did not end up good, I think it is foolish to waste one’s life because of this. It is better to graduate from the university and move somewhere. Crazy people take part in rallies and usually they are adults. In general, students  are afraid of everything.</i>

If I become a professional, I will try to leave it for a country with a higher standard of living. We can live a normal life here, but everyone aims to get something better.</i>
                <i>It is quite strange that the country has been governed for so long by the same man. But if he turns out doing it pretty well, why not? Although the norm is when the change of power does occur occasionally. Maybe new people would develop something different, because now the country remains unchanged for 20 years. And to make a career in politics without any connections or money is difficult. You will be more likely to end up taken into the forest, if you try to oppose people in power.</i>

We need stability and people who would continue to do their job well the way they have been doing it before. It is a cold calculation, but it is certainly true.

                <i>In my university group the moods are totally passive - we can only joke about politics. And this model can be used to describe the situation in the whole country. People seem to need a leader and they do not want to do anything on their own. At the same time they can turn out wanting stability and being afraid of changes. The elder the person is, the more conservative (s)he becomes. I think this is the problem of our mentality.</i>
                <i>Protesting is difficult: there have been many cases when students were caught at the square and expelled from the university. And in future it would put an end to your career.</i>
