								<p>
									The “Stolen Days" (2014-2017) project deals with the things political prisoners have missed while being in jail. It focuses on representatives of various political and social movements of Belarus: nationalists, anarchists, environmentalists, social activists.
									<br><br>
									All these people were united by the fact that Lukashenko’s regime viewed each of them as dangerous; forces to be suppressed. At some point their daily routine, their friends and beloved ones, their plans and habitual customs, joys and grievances became unreachable, stored only in their memories. Their realities narrowed to a life inside a detention cell. After the liberation of my project’s heroes, I waited for them to do the things they had been missing. And at that time I was nearby.
									<br><br>
									The Belarusian special services have adopted the experience of the Soviet era: covert arrests at home and at work, harassment of relatives, pressure in the workplace and in universities, conversation tapping. All these things are becoming a new routine of those who are brave enough to be politically active. Around a half of asked detainees refused to participate in the project. This is an expected result for the situation where the focus of the media could provoke a new round of repression.
									<br><br>
									Most politically motivated arrests in Belarus are conducted according to a standardised scheme: activists are detained and charged with violation of the Administrative Code (petty hooliganism, Art.17.1 or resistance to police Art.23.4). The detention reports are set on carbon paper, where the police also act as witnesses. Then the case goes to the court, where the judge gives guilty records after 10-15 minutes, regardless evidence given by the defense.
									<br><br>
									Over the last 20 years, arrests, heavy fines and propaganda in pro-government media have become essential tools in the fight against all the forms of public protest in Belarus. This tactic has proved itself to be effective. Very few critically-minded Belarusians are willing to risk their work, education and sometimes even health. It seems that this fruitless and often painful experience is embedded in nation’s collective memory. A combination of fear and inactivity has become a pattern of behavior and a condition of survival.
									<br><br>
									When talking to dozens of adults and young people, who are extremely brave and love their country, I asked them one question to which I had no answer myself. I was wondering what was the way out of the state of stagnation Belarus finds itself at the moment. What each one of us could do?

                <p>Eugene was arrested at the entrance to his house, when he was coming home after work. He works at the radio "Racia", which does not have a permission to broadcast legally in Belarus and thus broadcasts from Poland. Eugene explains his arrest by his journalistic practice, in particular connecting it with his coverage of the Ukrainian events in winter 2013-2014. During his imprisonment, he missed a Belarusian language course "Mova Nanova." Assisting in the organization of this course, he promotes the Belarusian language in his native city.</p>

                <h2>Andrei Tkachov, 27 years old, a fitness-trainer.</h2>
                <p># 15 days in jail</p>
                <p>Andrei works as a fitness-trainer. During his imprisonment he missed a few games of the NBA Championship. His friends brought into his cell the printouts of the matches. </p>
                <i>"Prison lacks basic things, for example one would wish to get some fresh air or take a shower. I was also not happy with the meals. They were arranged in such a manner that the last meal of the day was at 6 pm, and you had to spend the rest of the day hungry. Also there are some problems with the food calories, being there I actually lost 9 kilos."</i>

                <p>During the arrest, he was going to meet with his friend Sasha, which he had not seen for a long time. Roma was detained during the breakdown of punk concert by riot policemen in January 2015. He was staying close to punk distro (CDs, books, T-shirts) and attracted the attention of police.

                <p># 20 days in jail</p>
                <p>Vadim and his friend were arrested by special forces at home. He was charged for painting an illegal graffiti under Article 339.2 "Malicious hooliganism" (imprisonment for up to 6 years), but thanks to the public outcry the court dismissed the charge. After the detention he lost his job because his employers feared pressure from the authorities. He also missed the concert of his favorite band “Dzieciuki”.</p>
                <i>We were lying on the floor, handcuffed. From time to time stun guns were used against us - on the back and legs - as a way to get our testimony. During my stay in prison pressure was exerted on my parents, too - our house was searched. My mother had a recent surgery, due to which she was recognized disabled. And it was one of our cracks they had been trying to tap to break me. I tried to keep calm. It was important not to show fear.
                    <br>I subconsciously keep in mind that I am eavesdropped and surveilled. On the eve of the presidential election in 2015, every day I used to notice a few people who were watching us. But I do not want to leave the country. Otherwise it would be their victory - they want to make all the active people leave Belarus.</i>
