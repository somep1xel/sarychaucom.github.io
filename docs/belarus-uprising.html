                  The protests of 2020 have become the largest in the history of Belarus. At first, they were caused by the falsification of the presidential elections, but they became truly massive after it became known about the massive violence against the detainees and the first deaths of demonstrators. Society did not tolerated with cruelty and political violence.
                  <br><br>
                  All this has already become a part of the new history of Belarus: barricades, shooting rubber bullets at unarmed protesters and stun grenades; hundreds of people who have been tortured in police stations and in Okrestina prison; grief for the killed; women's protest, which brought hundreds of thousands of Belarusians out of their stupor into the streets; weekly Sunday protests; decentralization of protest and the emergence of local courtyard communities; tension and increased danger in September; escalation of street violence by security forces in October-November.
